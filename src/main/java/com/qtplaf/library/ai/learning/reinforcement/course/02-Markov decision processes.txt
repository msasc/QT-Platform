Markov decision processes describe an environment for RLearning

The future is independent of the past given the present: S(t) is Markov if
    P[S(t+1)|S(t)] = P[S(t+1)|S(1,...t)]

-   The state captures all relevent information from the history
-   Once the state is known, the history can be forget
-   The state is sufficient statistic of the future
